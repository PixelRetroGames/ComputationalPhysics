## Computational physics homework
 This is the result of sleepless nights and hours upon hours of searching the right formulas.

## Ballistic Curve
For a given target it calculates the angle that a projectile should be shot in order to hit the target with a given acceptable error. The angle is found using binary search and simulating the trajectory. Each target can be hit using two angles, but the program will always return the smallest angle of the two.

## Triple Pendulum
Simulates a triple pendulum. After the simulation is ready, it creates a film and the simulation can be viewed in real time.
